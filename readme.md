# MasterPlan

MasterPlan is project management software for independent users. If you need to share plans across a whole company on an online site, there are tools for that. But if you just want to keep track of your todo list, version control your project plan, or make an ideaboard, MasterPlan is for you.

## History

A few days before the initial commit to this repository, I was working on an indie game, and thought I needed a tool to help me plan out the rest of it. I asked on Twitter for some suggestions of software to try, and found that while they were solid choices, they weren't as applicable to independent development as I would have liked. Most project management software is designed for use by a large team, or even a large company.

The problem with project management software today for indie projects:

1) They’re cloud-based.
2) They’re slow, generally; written in Javascript or other web technologies.
3) They can be more complex than necessary to use.
4) Even if they offer a download, they might require hosting a server that works with PHP (or some other language) to serve you the management pages.
5) They can’t easily be version controled.

Features that are beneficial for large groups of developers become sticking points for individuals, and so I decided to make a tool to help independent developers plan out projects. Fast forward a few days, and MasterPlan has come into existence.

MasterPlan aims to address these same sticking points. It's a normal, native, downloadable application that stores project data on your computer. The data is plain JSON text files, and can be easily committed to a version control system. The goal for MasterPlan is to make a project management tool / visual ideaboard tool that is easy to use and extremely simple. I believe it is reaching this goal.


Note that this is just the code repository and external issue / bug tracker for MasterPlan; actual releases won't be available for download or purchase here.
