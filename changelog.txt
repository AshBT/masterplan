v0.2.3

-------

Ability to rename Boards. Adding a button for this, the Rename button, to the right of the currently active Board.
Adding Cloudy theme.
MasterPlan now is more Unicode character compliant (this means that common Latin characters for non-English languages like À or Æ can be typed and display correctly). 
Note that I have to design the characters myself, so not every character is implemented currently. Let me know on the forums if a language is missing characters: https://itch.io/board/555951/general
Switching out the font from Monaco to my own, Excel.
Fix: Can't release mouse over status bar.
Fix: Selection rectangle offset over the individual characters when selecting text in Textbox.
FIX: Text selection and highlighting improved, fixed for center-aligned text.
FIX: Task and its clone share deadline properties.

v0.2.2

-------

Adding option to disable Task Outlines.
Images now lock to a grid when scaling - to disable this, hold shift while dragging their size.
Adding an "Open Recent" menu to the right-click context menu.
Making Open Recent menu have an option stating no recent plans have been opened if that's the case, rather than being blank.
MP can now take screenshots without the GUI using the F11 shortcut or the Screenshot context menu option.
Projects now save which Board is active.
Adding 3D shadow type.
Lengthening smooth shadow slightly.
Filtering images using anisotropic filtering for clearer zooming.
Program settings file is now called "masterplan-settings.json".
Updating a few themes to update shadow color.
Fix: Can't select the task below the top-most Task on the Board using the keyboard.
Fix: Settings is always saved next to the MasterPlan executable.
Fix: Autoloading last plan wasn't being loaded properly.
Fix: Numbering sequence was broken across all Boards except the first one. 
Fix: Auto-load checkbox not properly loaded on running MasterPlan.
Fix: All Tasks update now. Before it was just the ones on the current Board. This fixes timers and sounds not playing when switching Boards.
Fix: Stopping all playing sounds works across all Boards.
Fix: Searching for a Task switches to the Board it resides on.
Fix: Boards are now numbered starting from 1, rather than 0.

v0.2.1

-------

Added Boards. A Board represents a collection of Tasks. Boards are selected by utilizing the Board selection menu at the top-right (or an 
    associated shortcut, which is Ctrl + 1, 2, 3..., 0). You can add Boards by clicking on the + button in that same menu. Empty Boards (Boards
    that don't contain any Tasks) are deleted if they are not open.
Added the Board number on the grid background at origin (0, 0).
Added Cut Tasks option and shortcut. Pasting cut Tasks move them to the mouse's position.
Fixed wording of Log messages that mention "Tasks" to mention "Task(s)" instead (to cover singular Task use cases).

You can now configure the sound playback sample rate in the Project Settings.
Sample rate is now set to 22050 by default (the only sample rate that seems to play sounds back flawlessly in my tests, oddly) on Mac.
Fix: Unable to load .plan files on Mac because the most recent Mac OS version seems to have trouble recognizing file extensions in some cases. So 
    instead, I'm just removing the filter on the File Open dialog for now.
Fix: On Mac, shortcuts can now use Super instead of Control. Note that I'm still allowing people to use Control for those shortcuts as well if they 
    prefer.
Loading saved plans are validated a little bit more - if the file loaded isn't valid JSON or does not have a "Tasks" entry, then the load will fail 
    gracefully.
Fix: New Tasks now are created beneath the top-most selected Task, regardless of numbering sequence.
Pasting Tasks now pastes them below the last Task selected, in the same column.
Fix: Dragging image or sound files over MasterPlan create associated Tasks, but don't automatically load the media.

v0.2.0
_______

Fix: Splashscreen not displaying on Mac build.
Splash screen now displays for 1.5 seconds minimum.
Hopeful Fix: Set application build type to GUI on Windows, making it so the command prompt doesn't appear when running.
FIX: Task bar not filling for Timer when running.
Adding splash screen.
FIX: Task completion time constantly set on save for parent Tasks with completed subtasks.
Adding Timer Task type. The Timer allows people to add Timers to their plan, allowing them to better control how and when they work. It allows for 
    Pomodoro-style timing-based workflows (work for x minutes, rest for y minutes, repeat) into their daily development. Timers that are next to 
    each other trigger in sequence, much like Sound Tasks.
Sound Tasks now have buttons for playing, pausing, and restarting sounds.
Completing Tasks with [C] now is displayed as a notification.
Deadline patterns cycle faster to indicate urgency.
Changed deadline icons and patterns a bit.

FIX: Couldn't type caps in textbox after Ctrl+A to select all text.
FIX: Couldn't hold shift and click to select text.
Saving version number in .plan save file. This is to allow backwards compatibility being built in with previous saves in case features are added, changed, or removed.
FIX: Crash if starting MasterPlan and Autoload Last Project setting didn't save.

Major changes - Resource management improvements.
Resources (images and GIFs) are now stored in a central location on the Project and are reused between Tasks.
Resource downloading and loading has been improved by the addition of the usage of a MIME type detection library. This allows for MasterPlan to see 
    what kind of file a file is after downloading, even if the file doesn't have the correct filepath. This means that Paste Content now works much 
    more reliably across media found on the Internet.
Lengthening the amount of time messages are on screen (5 seconds to 7 seconds).
Escape key now defocuses textboxes.
Enter key now is also a shortcut to jump to the next Task in a search when the searchbar is highlighted (like Ctrl+F). Shift+Enter goes back (much like Shift+Ctrl+F).
Adding project setting to save sounds that are currently playing.

FIX: Percentage didn't fill a Task if under 1% filled. That value has now been bumped to 0.01%.
FIX: Log reporting selection and deselection of Tasks was incorrect.
FIX: Pasting Tasks now lowers them below the column of existing Tasks (if the Task is completable). A TODO is to make all Tasks able to have 
    neighbors so you can shift them around easily using the keyboard.
FIX: Crash if using Ctrl+V to paste Tasks with no Tasks copied.
FIX: Crash if playing resampled audio and looping it multiple times (4-6 in my tests on a specific file). This seems to be FIXed by lowering the 
    quality of resampling (quality of 4 > quality of 1).
FIX: Hang when deleting Tasks due to Tasks registering their neighbors that include themselves, resulting in a loop (A.TaskAbove = B, B.TaskAbove = 
    A). This is resolved by comparing Task positions more absolutely to determine whether a Task is another's neighbor.

Massive textbox improvements.
You can now select blocks of text in textboxes, either by mouse click and drag, or by holding shift and using the keyboard.
Ctrl + A selects all Text.
You can now copy, paste, and cut text to/from the system clipboard in textboxes.
FIX: Navigating text lines by keyboard in textboxes is no longer as inaccurate. Clicking on lines is also vastly improved.

You can now move multiple Tasks at a time with the keyboard.
You can now select multiple Tasks using Shift + up or down arrow.
Ctrl + arrow keys now move Tasks, rather than Shift. This is a bit more awkward, but more consistent with how holding shift allows for selecting 
    multiple Tasks with the mouse.
Moving Tasks no longer adjusts the indentation. This seems better to keep Tasks arranged consistently and not jump around when moving groups of 
    Tasks around.
Escape now deselects all Tasks.
Page Up and Page Down now selects the first or last Task in a column, respectively.
FIX: Shadows no longer render on top of Tasks.
FIX: You can now pan while dragging Tasks.
FIX: Projects couldn't restore the pan of the camera from saved plans. To resolve this, creating new Tasks now no longer focuses the view on them.
HOPEFUL FIX: Zoom locks when close to targeted zoom. Seems like I was getting some artifacting at 1x zoom level, but I can't seem to reproduce it 
    reliably. This should help make sure the zoom never stays at fractional levels.

Other assorted code rearrangings and minor fixes.

v0.1.2
_______

MasterPlan now maintains global program settings in an external file.
FIX: Crash due to color theme spinner pointing to a theme that no longer exists if a theme is deleted or renamed.
FIX: Minor shadow bug (shadow blitting should be down by a pixel to not have jank on outer vertical edge).
Shadows are now "brighter" / denser.
Color theme spinner is wider now.
Themes reload when opening project settings now.
Adding Shade Thrower 3099 cyberpunk theme.
Changing notification fading from linear to cubic interpolation, making it easier to read for longer before it disappears.
Adding an icon for broken sounds.
More notifications display for loading images and sounds.
FIX: #7 - Backspace teleports to origin for a frame before animating pan.
New Tasks are opened after creation.
Adding option for autoloading last saved project.
FIX: Context menu now never opens offscreen (#9).
FIX: Current value can't go above maximum for Progression Tasks. (#12)
